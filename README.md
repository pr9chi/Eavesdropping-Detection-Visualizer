🎯 Purpose
This educational tool simulates quantum communication between Alice and Bob, showing how the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve) can be detected through increased error rates in quantum measurements.

✨ Features
- **Interactive Menu System**: Choose between different simulation scenarios
- **Secure Transmission**: Simulate communication without eavesdropping
- **Eavesdropping Detection**: Demonstrate how Eve's presence increases error rates
- **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side analysis of both scenarios
- **Educational Output**: Clear, step-by-step explanation of results

🔬 How It Works
1. **Alice** sends qubits using random bits and measurement bases
2. **Bob** receives and measures using his own random bases
3. Both parties compare bases and keep matching measurements
4. **Without Eve**: Error rate remains very low (~0-2%)
5. **With Eve**: Error rate jumps significantly (~25%) due to quantum measurement disturbance

🎓 Educational Use
Perfect for:
- Quantum computing course projects
- Cryptography demonstrations
- Understanding BB84 protocol basics
- Security presentations on quantum communication
